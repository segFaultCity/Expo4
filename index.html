              <span>You must have location services enabled for Geolocation to work. If you have this turned off, this site will not display anything.</span>
              <span>Zoom in to see your exact location once you allow location service!</span><br><br>
              <span>What I added/Implemented:</span>
              <ul>
                  <li>For the first step, I added the basic google maps API via a link in the html file.</li>
                  <li>To grant access to this API, I had to create an API key through the developers console.</li>
                  <li>To add more functionality, I added the Geolocation service (pinpoints your location and displays it on their map) that Google offers with the Maps API. Luckily, there was a lot of documentation to help!</li>
                  <li>Lastly, for this segment, I added Google Maps Markers to show your current location in accordance with the University of Missouri. This was unbelievably easy to add though after reading a short document on it.</li>
              </ul>

          <div class="titleContain"><span>2.</span><span class="rTitle">Street View Platform</span></div>
          <div id="streetView"></div>
          <div class="description">
              <span>This street view was implemented to start from your current location, so location services must be allowed!</span>
              <span>Check out your surroundings...Pretty familiar huh? (This view may be a street or a block off based on your current location. Check the streets on the Map above and compare it to the one labeled at the top left for the street view and make sure you're close to your current location!) </span><br><br>
              <span>Implementing this platform:</span>
              <ul>
                  <li>The Street view was really simple to add and took far fewer lines of code to incorporate after adding the Google Map.</li>
                  <li>After already configuing a users current location, it was simple to make the street view start near that exact position.</li>
              </ul>
